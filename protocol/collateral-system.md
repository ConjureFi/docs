# Collateral System

### Summary

In Conjure minting a Synth is technically opening a Collateralized Dept Position \(CDP\) working as a loan. If a user wishes to mint a synth they have to come up with a deposit in Ethereum to create the underlying collateralization. 

### Loans

All synths have to be minted. In order to create value and establish an underlying value for a minted asset, the user has to provide a certain amount of ETH as collateral in order to take the loan. 

When opening a loan Conjure aims for a 120% collateral ratio. On the loan tab, a user can see exactly how much ETH they have to deposit in order to get to a certain C-Ratio.  

After the loan is taken out the specified amount is then minted to the user's wallet and the ETH is transferred into the smart contract where the loan collateral is being held.
