# Introduction

Conjure allows anyone to create tokenized assets on Ethereum representing any asset you can imagine. The resulting Synths are fully collateralized by Ether and have their collateralization and value pegged via a powerfully flexible ability to combine multiple arbitrary price sources to produce a single reference price.

Conjure is permissionless \(akin to Uniswap or Balancer\) and permits the creation of assets representing - for example - synthetic currencies, tokens from other blockchains, real world commodities, and exotic assets such as basket currencies and indices.
